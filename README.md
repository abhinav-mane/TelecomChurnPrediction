# Telecom Churn Prediction
> You have a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers. The main types of attributes are:

    Demographics (age, gender etc.)
    Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)
    Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)

 

> Based on all this past information, you want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. It is a binary variable - 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned.
